👋 Hi there, I'm Ankit Kumar!

🎓 I'm pursuing my Master of Computer Applications (M.C.A.) at Roorkee Institute of Technology, Roorkee.

💻 Passionate about full-stack development, web technologies, and open-source contributions.

📚 I love building projects that solve real-life problems and help me explore new technologies.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on ...Front-end projects that are impactful, creative, and help me grow as a developer.

⚡ Fun fact: 💡 I once spent 3 hours fixing a bug, only to realize it was a missing semicolon.
