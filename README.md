# Hi there, I'm Ankit Kumar! 👋

🎓 I have completed my Master of Computer Applications (M.C.A.) from **Roorkee Institute of Technology**.  
💻 Passionate about **full-stack development**, **web technologies**, and **open-source contribution**.  
📚 I love building projects that solve real-life problems and help me explore new technologies.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **full-stack projects** that help me grow and contribute to meaningful development.

⚡ **Fun Fact:** I once spent 3 hours fixing a bug… only to realize it was a missing semicolon. 😄
